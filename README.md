In the excel file you will probably notice that quite a few values are left blank. If you sort by the W/L column all values that have UT and L purpesfully don't have data filled out. The ones that have W that are not filled out will be filled out soon. The UT and L valued columns will have a few columns filled out put in for further analysis on losses.

W : Wins L : Losses UT: Untradeable

Wins are trades that fit criteria for this setup and moved upwards and hit my profit target. 

Losses are trades that fit criteria for this setup and moved downwards and hit my stop loss. 

Untradeable(s) are trades that fit technical criteria but had one or more major fundamental (or non-specifiable technical) faults, like large overhead supply, huge dilution (ATM or direct offering), gap down on open,etc. 


The reason that the data is not complete is because it is always changing, in any given week I may add or delete 20-50 data points depending on what my analysis is telling me to do. So to me the data is complete, it is just always a work in progress. 

Along with that, due to the speceficity of the data all of the data that is in there has been input manually by me. I am working on finding an API that will allow me more freedom in terms of accessing data at very specefic points and very specefic times. This is probably my next most important task, especially as my trading strategies change even more. 

But this is mianly why it is a slower process for inputting data and why there are lots of blank cells. 


I use this sheet as a guide, I will firsty go through and test different things within the sheet, like filtering out different combination. Then I will check my analysis page for basic things like averages, mins, maxs and std dev. I also do this with the linear reg model except I will just use the slope equation. Once I have either the equation or averages I need I will go through a large repository of data that I have collected in another excel file and backtest my new 'solution' to see if it works or not, then record my results.
